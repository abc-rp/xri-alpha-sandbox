   2. The User may disclose the Confidential Information to any of its officers, employees, advisers, subcontractors and contractors that need to know the relevant Confidential Information for the purposes of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement only, provided that it procures that each such person to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed complies with the obligations set out in this clause 3 as if they were the User and procures that any such person is legally or contractually bound by similar obligations of confidentiality to those set out herein.

   7. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that xRI may have, the User acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the terms of this clause 3 by the User. Accordingly, xRI shall be entitled to the remedies of injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this clause 3.

1.  – Evaluation Data
A description of the evaluation data:
Source of data
* Alpha quality dataset gathered across Winter 2023/24
* Data collected by 2 proprietary Built Environment Scanning Systems across 8 GB cities
* Sensor data obtained from LiDAR, RGB cameras, Infra-red cameras and GPS / INS / Odometry
* Information linked to UK National Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRN), linking to WGS84 Lat / Long and / or British National Grid
* Information contained in the dataset may comprise Day or Night (Date time in UTC)
Data size
* Approximately 60GB unzipped
* Approximately 10GB larger when all point clouds are decompressed
Remarks on the data:
* This is alpha quality data for evaluation purposes only
* UPRNs contained within the dataset do not necessarily correlate to a specific city or region across the 8 GB cities. You should assume a random allocation
* Most UPRNs will have either day or night, but are unlikely to have both
* It is possible hardware was temporarily unavailable during certain scanning periods, hence some UPRNs will not have all sensor modalities available
