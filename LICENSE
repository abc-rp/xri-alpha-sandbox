Schedule 1  – Evaluation Data

A description of the evaluation data:
Source of data
    • Alpha quality dataset gathered across Winter 2023/24
    • Data collected by 2 proprietary Built Environment Scanning Systems across 8 GB cities
    • Sensor data obtained from LiDAR, RGB cameras, Infra-red cameras and GPS / INS / Odometry
    • Information linked to UK National Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRN), linking to WGS84 Lat / Long and / or British National Grid
    • Information contained in the dataset may comprise Day or Night (Date time in UTC)
Data size
    • Approximately 60GB unzipped
    • Approximately 10GB larger when all point clouds are decompressed
Remarks on the data:
    • This is alpha quality data for evaluation purposes only
    • UPRNs contained within the dataset do not necessarily correlate to a specific city or region across the 8 GB cities. You should assume a random allocation
    • Most UPRNs will have either day or night, but are unlikely to have both
    • It is possible hardware was temporarily unavailable during certain scanning periods, hence some UPRNs will not have all sensor modalities available
